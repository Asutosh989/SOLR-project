Fast forward to today and we&#x27;re profitable, growing steadily, debt free and are about to be acquired (there are LOIs on the table). You may ask what the problem is? Well, the problem is that I&#x27;m supremely unhappy.<p>Each morning for the past couple months, my first thought has been &quot;What could today be like if I didn&#x27;t work here?&quot;. I drift off into exploring what it would be like to work at Wal Mart, or the construction site outside, or as a bagger at a grocery store. It seems so stress free. Then, my phone starts ringing for the day and I&#x27;m snapped back to reality. This morning, I locked myself in the bathroom with the shower running (don&#x27;t want wife to know) and cried my eyes out. I haven&#x27;t cried in many years. It felt great, but only for an hour.<p>So, from my (possibly skewed) point of view, I have 2 options:<p>- Quit, which effectively kills any acquisition and likely the company as well<p>- Suck it up and work on the same thing for 2-5 more years<p>I&#x27;d been mulling over a third option (hire someone to do my day-to-day), but don&#x27;t know how to make it work. The product is just too complicated (tons of domain knowledge required) for someone to come in and take over. Additionally, the product just isn&#x27;t that interesting (glorified CRUD app) and it&#x27;s been hard to retain developers.<p>Please tell me I&#x27;m missing something! Maybe I&#x27;m just being ridiculous- it&#x27;s getting hard to tell. Is it common for a Founder to go through this train of thought before an acquisition? Is there a trick to convince yourself you want to keep doing this? Maybe I&#x27;m suffering from some kind of depression and need drugs.<p>Any advice appreciated.<p>- A founder in pain","time":1495724786,"title":"Ask HN: I don't want to be a founder anymore","type":"story"},

Competitor looks to be based in CA also.<p>A friend and I have been building an app as a little side project for a few years. With work and real-life etc. it&#x27;s been stuck in beta for quite some time, but we were actually hoping to launch this weekend.<p>Today we discover that a competitor launched with an identical concept. Fine, it&#x27;s an obvious concept that I was surprised no-one had come up with already, and we lifted a large part of the UI from Tinder anyway. What I&#x27;m concerned about is that they also copied the name (changing one letter: Chowder (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getchowder.com) -&gt; Chowdr (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chowdrapp.com)) and filed a trademark.<p>Is there prior art for trademarks in the US (we have been publicly visible as Chowder since ~February 2016, it seems their trademark was filed in March 2016)? I was able to find some info about the trademark (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bizapedia.com&#x2F;trademarks&#x2F;chowdr-87042422.html) - of note is that they have a pseudo-mark for &#x27;Chowder&#x27; as well.<p>While I&#x27;m annoyed that this person lifted the concept and the name, I am more worried that they will make a trademark infringement move on us as soon as we launch properly, which we cannot afford to defend against.<p>If it makes any difference, we have the option to become a registered company in the UK (where I am based), however we planned to launch in the US initially anyway, so I assume this would still classify as infringement?<p>Any advice would be appreciated.
